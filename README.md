# Gravity Rip Helper

## Gravity RIP

[Gravity RIP](https://gravity.rip/)  is a co-operative tabletop RPG by [Luke Westaway](https://twitter.com/lukewestaway), built to tell the rad-as-hell stories of pilots competing in the RIP Racing League. This complete theatre-of-the-mind tabletop system is everything you need for 1,200km/h sci-fi racing adventures, with distinct modes of play for both furious anti-gravity racing, and off-track drama.

## How to use the helper

This helper is designd to be used **only** in the *Racing Mode* phase of the game

A standard grid of 20 nameless-faceless NPCs will be provided to you with randomly generated names. Note that it is entirely up to the GM whether or not these names are to be used in the canon of your games.

Click on the circle at the center of the tile to select an avatar to be placed at that position. This could be one of your player characters, or an NPC.

During the course of the game, as the players (and NPCs) progress, you can drag the corresponding tiles and drop them to their updated positions in the race track. The other tiles will rearrange themselves automatically to reflect their updated positions.
